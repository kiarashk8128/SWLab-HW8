Report of the Project


Seperate Query From Modifer Refactoring:
The change was applied to the getNextParam function because it was calling the getNextParameter function which was both returning a value and modifying the index.
So we added another Query method for getting the value and in the getNextParameter we call that, and then seperately modify the index.



Self Encapsulated Field:
The change was applied to klasses variable which was accessed directly in the methods. and this is how it was refactored:
1- Create a getter (and optional setter) for the field. They should be either protected or public.
2- Find all direct invocations of the field and replace them with getter and setter calls.
So a getter and setter function was written for it and then the getter was called instead of calling directly in methods.
